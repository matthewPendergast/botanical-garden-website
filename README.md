<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>This is a static website representing a fictional garden, made using basic HTML, CSS, Sass, and JavaScript as part of a goal to teach myself how to design a professional website.</p>
<p>It is an earlier project of mine with which I started learning web development, and as such there are many things I would do differently now given the knowledge and skills I've gained in the time since.</p>
<p>The website itself has a few interesting features, including a custom-built JavaScript event calendar, a working photo gallery, and informational sections that would typically be seen in a real website. It was designed with thoughtfulness in regard to color scheme, UI/UX design choices, and a potential target audience.</p>
<p>Some pages are unfinished (Weddings, Volunteer, Cafe, and backend integration for Memberships), but I hope to revisit this project idea and refine it at some point. However, I do like the idea of keeping this project in its current state, as it shows the progress I've made since the point in which it was actively worked on (August 2024.)</p>
<p>It's not perfect, and I can see a lot of room for improvement, but this project helped me immensely with diving into web development, and overall I feel very satisfied with how it turned out!</p>
