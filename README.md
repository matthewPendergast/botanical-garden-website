# Overview

This is a static website representing a fictional garden, made using basic HTML, CSS, Sass, and JavaScript as part of a goal to teach myself how to design a professional website.

It is an earlier project of mine with which I started learning web development, and as such there are many things I would do differently now given the knowledge and skills I've gained in the time since.

## Key Features

- Custom JavaScript event calendar
- Dynamically-populated photo gallery with captions
- Realistic informational sections

It was designed with thoughtfulness in regard to color scheme, UI/UX design choices, and the potential target audience.
